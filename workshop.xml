    description="Everything bleeds Instant Deathium... including you. Now with compatibility in other mods!

This mod will function regardless of its position in your mod list, but if you want perk descriptions to be accurate, place this mod *below* any mods that add perks that change the player's blood type. If you aren't sure if any of your mods do this, place this mod below them anyway; it won't hurt anything."
